# Fine-Tuning Vision-Language Models (Qwen2-VL-7B)

This notebook demonstrates a **basic implementation** of fine-tuning the [`Qwen2-VL-7B`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-VL) Vision-Language Model using the Hugging Face ecosystem.

---

## Overview

- **Model**: Qwen2-VL-7B (Multimodal Transformer with Vision and Language capability)
- **Platform**: Hugging Face Transformers, Datasets, and Accelerate
- **Goal**: Learn and demonstrate how to fine-tune a VLM on custom or open-source multimodal datasets using basic tools from Hugging Face.

---

## What You’ll Learn

- How to load and configure a multimodal transformer (Qwen2-VL-7B)
- How to prepare image-text datasets for fine-tuning
- How to tokenize and process vision-language pairs
- How to train and evaluate a VLM using `transformers` and `accelerate`
- How to save and push your model to the Hugging Face Hub

---

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

You may also need:

- `python>=3.12`

---

## Dataset

You can use any Hugging Face-compatible image-text dataset. The notebook provides examples of using the ChartQA dataset from Huggingface

---

## Model: Qwen2-VL-7B

- A large-scale, open-source Vision-Language Model
- Supports image input + text output for tasks like:
  - Image captioning
  - Visual question answering (VQA)
  - Multimodal instructions

---

## Training Configuration

- **Trainer**: Custom training loop or `Trainer` API from `transformers`
- **Optimizer**: AdamW or 8-bit optimizers from `bitsandbytes` for memory efficiency
- **FP16 / bfloat16**: Optional mixed-precision support
- **LoRA (PEFT)**: Optional Low-Rank Adaptation for efficient fine-tuning
- **Evaluation**: Optional metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, or VQA accuracy

---

## Fine-Tuning Steps

1. Load the pretrained Qwen2-VL model and processor
2. Load and preprocess a vision-language dataset
3. Tokenize text and transform images
4. Set up data collator and training arguments
5. Fine-tune the model (optionally using PEFT or quantization)
6. Save and/or upload the model to Hugging Face Hub

---

## Saving & Sharing

After training:

```python
model.save_pretrained("your_model_name")
processor.save_pretrained("your_model_name")
```

To push to Hugging Face Hub:

```python
model.push_to_hub("your-username/your-model")
processor.push_to_hub("your-username/your-model")
```

---

## Example Use Cases

- Adapting Qwen2-VL to your domain-specific VQA task
- Training the model to follow multimodal instructions (e.g., “Describe this chart”)
- Experimenting with image-grounded chat agents

---

## Notes

- This notebook is intended for **learning and experimentation**, not production-level training.
- For large-scale training, consider using more advanced setups like distributed training via `accelerate` or DeepSpeed.
- LoRA or QLoRA can significantly reduce resource requirements.
